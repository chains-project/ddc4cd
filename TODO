* Add support for fetching init.sh from other source
* Add support to release resulting binary - possibly another binary than tcc, ie. the resulting tcc from successful DDC is used to compile another source code
* Make report better perhaps

Low priority:
* Add version to build dirs to allow different version of the same compiler to be used
