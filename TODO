* Document the code/workflow
* Clean up repo from debug/testing
* Make release notes prettier
* Add TCC_COMMITHASH to builds so users more easily know which src the compiler is based on
* add lintian to workflow for static analysis of .deb

Low priority:
* Add version to build dirs to allow different version of the same compiler to be used (can be achieved by changing nixpkgs hash)
