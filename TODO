* Document the code/workflow
* Clean up repo from debug/testing
* Make release notes prettier
  - Add version of each ancestor compiler to release notes
* Add mac compatibility
* Add docker for testing .deb and tarball

Low priority:
* Add version to build dirs to allow different version of the same compiler to be used (can be achieved by changing nixpkgs hash)
* add lintian to workflow for static analysis of .deb
