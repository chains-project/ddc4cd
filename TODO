* Make report better: add nixpkgs hash used
* Document the code/workflow
* Clean up repo from debug/testing
* Binary tar.gz and .deb should be persistent in releases
* Version handling
  - .deb metadata and tcc-hardened binary should both contain the tcc source commit hash(short maybe 8 char) 

Low priority:
* Add version to build dirs to allow different version of the same compiler to be used (can be achieved by changing nixpkgs hash)
